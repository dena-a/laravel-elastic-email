# Laravel Elastic Email
A simple plugin to allow sending emails through Elastic E-Mail

## Installation

You can add Laravel Elastic Email as a dependency using the composer CLI:

```bash
$ composer require dena-a/laravel-elastic-email
```

For Laravel 5.1 - 5.3 add the package to your composer.json and run composer update.

```json
"require": {
	"dena-a/laravel-elastic-email": "1.0.3"
},
```

Next add the following to your config/services.php
```php
'elastic_email' => [
	'key' => env('ELASTIC_KEY'),
	'account' => env('ELASTIC_ACCOUNT')
]
```
and add the correct values to your .env file.

Third disable the laravel default MailServiceProvider in config/app.php and add the new ServiceProvider
```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Dena\LaravelElasticEmail\MailServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Finally switch your default mail provider to elastic email in your .env file by setting MAIL_DRIVER=elastic_email

### Usage ###

This package was constructed to work exactly the same as the normal laravel mailers and thus usage is the same.
